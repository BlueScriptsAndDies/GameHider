# GameHider

This is a little GUI to hide playing games.

There's a close, minimize, recenter, panic button, and link button.

Close - Close

Minimize - Minimize to a little bar

Recenter - Recenters GUI

Panic Button - You can set a panic button, when it's pressed it closes game (CAN'T BE FOCUSED ON GAME, CLICK THE TOP BAR THEN PRESS BUTTON)

Link Button - Opens that link in the GUI, like a game.

Why did I make this?

Ehhh didn't really make it chatgpt did, too lazy to learn javascript. For all of my other work, I make that myself. But for javascript things like these, I'll say I use chatgpt if I do. I'm also going to be honest about it becaue it's free & open source, so not really a big deal. Not going to sell this or anything again js smt cool ig.

But I think you know why I made this.
